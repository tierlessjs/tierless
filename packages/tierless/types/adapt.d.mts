 *  by the app's OWN factory with the tierless axios adapter at the bottom, so the app's
 *  interceptors run there too. Resolves to the axios-response subset real service code
 *  reads: { data, status, headers, statusText } — plain data, wire-safe. AxiosError-
 *  shaped rejections cross as errors and unwind into the compiled code's own try/catch. */
