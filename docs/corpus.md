# The corpus program — a statistical claim, not a demo

Goal: a defensible sentence of the form "across N real apps' own user journeys:
median X× less network wait, Y% less IO." One curated demo can't produce it; a
population of other people's apps can. Four rungs, each independently useful:

1. **Measurement harness** (`bench/harness/` — built). Playwright + CDP measures a
   scripted journey's real network behavior: per-request HTTP wire bytes, per-frame
   websocket bytes both directions, round trips, raw wall. Verified against socket
   ground truth (`bench/harness/verify.mts`: ws within a few bytes, HTTP within ~1%).
   Journeys are plain Playwright functions, so an app's existing e2e tests adapt in
   minutes.

2. **REST-proxy adapter + gateway** (folds into rung 3). Resources are an allow-listed
   namespace with an exec, so an adapter can declare an app's existing REST endpoints as
   `api.*` — no backend rewrite. The server host deploys as a thin gateway colocated
   with the backend: client↔server RTTs collapse into one migration; gateway↔backend
   hops are localhost.

3. **Porting recipe.** Per workflow, the client-side fetch/thunk orchestration becomes
   one plain sequential function entering through the Vite seam. Mechanical enough for
   an agent-assisted codemod; hardened on 2–3 real open-source apps end to end. What
   breaks here (auth flows, uploads, optimistic UI) is the compiler/runtime's
   requirements list.

4. **Corpus study.** 10–20 popular open-source apps **with e2e suites** — their tests
   define the journeys, not us. Port with the rung-3 tool, measure before/after with
   the rung-1 harness, report the **median and the full distribution per journey**,
   losers included. A journey dominated by backend compute won't move; showing that is
   what makes the rest credible.

## Run protocol (three runs, one job each)

A port is benchmarked by running the target's own e2e suite three times, never mixing
roles within a run:

1. **Baseline** — stock build + the measurement patch only (`ports/run.mts <name>
   --baseline`, separate work tree). Emits the per-test control JSONL.
2. **Profile** — ported build with recording on. This run gathers ALL adaptive
   evidence: the trajectory profile that prices workflow suffixes, and the shim's
   route evidence (which keys each route's envelope contains, when the app's XHRs
   fire relative to navigation, measured crossing times). Exploration policies —
   e.g. racing a held XHR against the network to learn which wins — are allowed in
   THIS run only. Its numbers are DISCARDED.
3. **Comparison** — ported build, recording off, exploration off. Every adaptive
   decision (hold vs network per key, migrate vs fetch) is FROZEN from the loaded
   profile artifact; a key the profile doesn't cover takes the deterministic
   fallback (straight to network — behaves like stock, never manufactures a wait).
   No racing, no learning, nothing self-modifying: two comparison runs of the same
   build and profile make the same decisions. Emits the measured JSONL that
   `ports/report.mts` joins against the baseline.

Measurement and certification never share a stack: each run gets a freshly booted
app (`boot.mts` kills whole process groups) and nothing else may touch its database
mid-run — a stray seed invalidates every test that was live.

**Test accommodations.** Some upstream tests assert the transport, not the UI —
`waitForResponse(...)` for a request the port eliminates can never fire. Rather than
maintaining an allow-list of expected failures, each such test gets a patch in the
recipe's `testPatches` that replaces the network wait with the equivalent UI wait
(e.g. "the task row is rendered"). Rules: applied to BOTH arms; may relocate a wait
but never weaken what the test asserts about the page; each hunk carries a comment
saying why. Failures that remain (e.g. a login provider whose container we don't
run) fail identically in both arms and fall out of the report's pass-parity gate,
listed with both statuses.

## Honesty constraints (bind all rungs)

- **Bytes and trips are measured; latency is modeled.** CDP's network throttling does
  not apply to websockets (long-standing Chromium limitation), so real throttling would
  bias exactly the before(HTTP)/after(ws) comparison. Latency claims are computed from
  measured (trips, bytes) under a declared RTT/bandwidth model — the same pattern as
  `bench/conduit.mts` — with the model parameters printed beside every number.
- **Workload selection is not ours.** Journeys come from the target app's own e2e
  suite, by a fixed rule (e.g. every journey tagged smoke/critical), chosen before
  measurement.
- **Distributions, not means.** Per-journey numbers, median highlighted, no aggregation
  across apps without the spread.
